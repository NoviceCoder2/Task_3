Hotel-Aggregator-Analysis
Problem Satement: to analyse a dataset of hotel aggregator listings using Power BI. The dataset comprises various attributes related to listings, hosts, reviews, and availability. The objective is to create comprehensive visualizations and insights that shed light on trends, patterns, and factors influencing the performance of listings. Through Power BI, interns will explore key metrics such as pricing, availability, host characteristics, and review scores to derive actionable insights for improving the overall quality and competitiveness of the listings.

Dataset Description:
1. id: Unique identifier for each listing.
2. listing_url: URL of the listing on the hotel aggregator platform.
3. scrape_id: Identifier for the data scraping event.
4. last_scraped: Date of the last data scrape.
5. source: Source of the listing information.
6. name: Name of the listing.
7. description: Description of the listing.
8. neighborhood_overview: Overview of the neighborhood where the listing is located.
9. picture_url: URL of the listing's picture.
10. host_id: Unique identifier for the host.
11. ... (and many more columns capturing details about hosts, location, property type, room details, amenities, pricing, availability, reviews, and other relevant information)
Project Objectives:
1. Geographical Insights:
- Visualize the distribution of listings on a map to identify popular neighborhoods.
- Explore the geographical concentration of listings and host locations.
2. Pricing and Availability Analysis:
- Analyze pricing trends based on property types, room types, and accommodation capacity.
- Investigate the availability of listings over time and identify peak periods.
3. Host Performance:
- Evaluate host characteristics, including superhost status, response times, and verification methods.
- Explore correlations between host attributes and listing performance.
4. Review Scores and Guest Satisfaction:
- Examine review scores and their impact on overall listing performance.
- Identify areas for improvement based on specific review categories.
5. Property Type and Room Analysis:
- Analyse the distribution of property types and room types.
- Explore trends in the popularity of specific accommodation setups.


General overview of the steps you would take to create the project:

Data Import: In Power BI Desktop, you import your dataset from various sources such as Excel files, databases, or online services.

Data Transformation: You perform data cleaning, shaping, and transformation using Power Query Editor within Power BI Desktop to prepare your data for analysis.

Data Modeling: You create relationships between different tables if necessary and define measures and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language.

Visualization: You create visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs, maps) based on your data and arrange them on report pages to tell a story or convey insights.

Interactivity: You add slicers, filters, and drill-through features to make your report interactive and allow users to explore the data.

Formatting: You format your visuals, adjust colors, fonts, and layout to make your report visually appealing and easy to understand.

Testing and Iteration: You review and test your report to ensure it accurately reflects your data and meets the project objectives. You may need to iterate on the design and functionality based on feedback.

Deployment: Once your report is complete, you publish it to the Power BI service or export it as a PBIX file for sharing with stakeholders.
